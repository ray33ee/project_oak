# Todo

- Create a builder class for the `Info` struct
- Figure out how to add the installer to the .data portion of executables
  - Create two executables, differing only in .data size and compare
- Use scoped name (os.rename) instead of temporary names (__rename)
- Add flags to any commands with multiplicity (see NSIS commands)
- Implement 'create' instruction and 'create shortcut'
- Add function to change file attributes
- Add extra functions
- Add special windows variables (%appdata%, %programfiles%, etc.)
- Add a bunch of tests (use a tempdir for this, and create files filled with garbage)
  - Test the following:
    - More complex iunstallers
    - Convert code to string and back again, compare code or strings to test compiler
- Add high level install and uninstall functions to oak script (to install and uninstall 3rd party)
- Function to check to see if already installed
- Add function that adds an uninstaller entry to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
- Convert specs list into a table with 3 columns, step name, action and inverse
- Add reg_append/remove_multi_key function that adds/removes a line from a multiline value 
- Add some path-specific functions (the inverses remove the added path, instead of saving the original path value)
- Create a third path type, one that (like Temporary) does not create inverses. 
  - Change is_temp() function to needs_inverse() function
