# Todo

- Clean up the remaining `Result::unrwap()` calls
- Create some tests to make sure unsuccessful installers unwind correctly
- Add flags to any commands with multiplicity (see NSIS commands)
- Implement create instruction and create shortcut
- Add a SHIT ton of tests (use a tempdir for this, and create files filled with garbage)
  - Test the following:
    - Variants for each `PathType`
    - More complex iunstallers
    - Convert code to string and back again, compare code or strings to test compiler
- Think about error handling
  - Oak Script errors: Wrong type of argument, for example. non-recoverable
  - Runtime errors: Invalid permissions error. Recoverable
- Convert specs list into a table with 3 columns, step name, action and inverse
- Add a more comprehensive Oak scripting language
  - A Script that can perform optimisations, and recognise files that can be moved to a temporary directory
  - Create an interpreter that uses the language
    - Enable the interpreter to display the installation progress to the terminal/GUI
  - Add high level install and uninstall functions to oak script
  - Function to add the uninstaller to a path, and add this to the registry
    - Function to check to see if already installed
